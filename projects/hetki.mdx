# Hetki

## Overview

Hetki is an AI-powered meditation and mental training application designed specifically for high performers across four key domains: athletes, esports players, professionals, and students. Unlike traditional meditation apps with pre-recorded content, Hetki generates personalized, context-aware meditation sessions in real-time based on your specific goals, current state, and biometric data.

## Key Features

- AI-Powered Personalization: Real-time generation of unique meditation sessions tailored to your specific context, goals, and current mental/physical state
- Multi-Domain Goal Framework: Three-pillar system covering Performance (excel in your domain), Recovery (restore and rest), and Life (fulfillment beyond your domain)
- Biometric Integration: Connects with Apple HealthKit (iOS) and Google Fit (Android) to track heart rate, sleep quality, and respiratory patterns
- Comprehensive Analytics: Provides mood tracking, effectiveness analysis, and data-driven insights showing meditation's measurable impact on your wellbeing and performance
- Context-Aware Content: Understands whether you're an athlete preparing for competition, a gamer optimizing performance, a professional managing stress, or a student focusing on academics
- Experience-Aware Adaptation: Adjusts content complexity from beginner-friendly guidance to advanced practitioner techniques as you develop your practice

## How It Works

Hetki uses a sophisticated AI system to create personalized meditation
experiences:

1. User Profiling: Creates a detailed profile based on your selected context (athlete/esports/professional/student), experience level, and personal goals
2. Real-Time Generation: AI analyzes your current state, recent biometric data, time of day, and meditation history to generate a unique session
3. Biometric Feedback Loop: Continuously learns from Apple HealthKit/Google Fit data (heart rate during meditation, sleep quality, etc.) to improve recommendations
4. Effectiveness Tracking: Monitors mood improvements, completion rates, and physiological responses to optimize future sessions
5. Progressive Development: The AI evolves content complexity and focus areas as your practice matures

Key Technical Challenges Solved:
- Real-time personalization at scale using context-aware AI generation
- Seamless biometric data integration across iOS and Android platforms
- Privacy-first architecture that keeps sensitive health data secure
- Adaptive learning system that balances exploration (trying new approaches) with exploitation (using what works)


## Technologies Used
### AI & Voice
- ElevenLabs API (Text-to-Speech for AI-generated meditation narration)
- Google Gemini (AI model for meditation content generation and personalization)
### Frontend
- React (Mobile app UI framework)
### Backend & API
- FastAPI (Python web framework for backend services)

## What's Next?

Next we are planning to utilize the conversational features of elevenlabs and integrate that to the app. It will give user more control and easier access. Through the conversation user is able to give more context to the meditation request.
